                Clouds, services, and servers
              </h2>
              <p>
                Cloud computing is essentially the concept that computing services such as storing information, running software, server usage and general computer tasks can be done via a cloud server (Microsoft 2021). The way this works is that a cloud services company sets up infrastructure on their end, while the end user can access their cloud and use their services via the internet. Some common examples of these are the Apple iCloud, or Google Drive. These two services offer online storage options for people. A simple way to think of these would be a hard drive that is constantly accessible online.

Although many tend to think of cloud services as online storage, there are many other applications for cloud services, such as cloud computing which comes in the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) (SoftwareTestingHelp 2021). The IaaS infrastructure is focussed on storage, operating system usage, virtual machines, and networking. This type of infrastructure if often utilised by businesses for its advantages in developing online IT infrastructure, helping to reduce overhead costs. The SaaS infrastructure offers services that allow users to connect and use an application online. Many of Google’s apps use the SaaS infrastructure, as well as examples such as Dropbox or MailChimp, in addition to big business utilizing it for storefronts. The PaaS infrastructure is very much focussed on software development and is marketed particularly toward developers. It allows teams of developers to eliminate system maintenance, patches, security updates etc and provides a constantly stable platform where developers can focus on the creating side of development and reduce time. These are the most common infrastructures used in cloud computing, however there is also Desktop as a Service which allows desktop use over a network for the user, and GaaS, which is for games as a service. Though the latter sounds somewhat like other cloud computing infrastructures, it is important to note that it is more of a business model that tends to utilise SaaS infrastructure.

According to LearnHub (2020), companies with one thousand employees or more are continuing to utilise cloud services, with up to 81 percent of these employing the technology. This is expected to grow to 90 percent by 2024. This could result in up to 75 percent of computing tasks for companies and organisations being done via a cloud service (LearnHub 2020). As an example of how cloud computing may be leveraged with future technology, quantum computing is already beginning to be utilised within the cloud computing field. Google and Microsoft have already begun to use this technology, and although it is early, the speed at which processing occurs with these powerful machines means the end result is a significant increase in efficiency or production (LearnHub 2020). Other possibilities in future for cloud services include the IoT, or Internet of all Things, Artificial Intelligence growth, digital infrastructure for smart cities via the cloud as population growth increases, and more immediately, serverless architecture. In essence, a serverless infrastructure determines the needs of a developer, and provides the infrastructure needed to support applications. This could be utilized in such a way that developers could divide software into parts and upload it onto the cloud depending on a client’s needs (LearnHub 2020). Although the technology within cloud services is likely to develop further such as leveraging the power of quantum computing, the real tangible advancements are not so much in the technology, but rather what the results of this technology can provide.

One area that is very likely to be impacted by cloud technology is automation. As has happened during the last century, the invention of new technology has often seen a reduction in jobs as the human worker would be replaced by an automated machine. In recent years, self-serve checkouts in supermarkets have been a common example of this.

As is often done, this results in media articles about machines taking away peoples jobs and creates a narrative that jobs will eventually not be abundant enough to support employment of the population. However, what is often not mentioned is that while certain jobs are lost, the creation of these new technologies often creates new jobs as well. In a study conducted in the U.K, it was found that 800,000 thousand jobs had been lost due to the rise of automation, however in the process, 3.5 million jobs had also been created (SensrTrx 2019), resulting in an overall gain of jobs being created. The caveat here though, is that the jobs lost were low-skilled jobs, while the jobs created required more specialised skills or training to perform. This could possibly be a contributing factor in the “digital divide” which refers to the gap in technological knowledge between demographics, commonly age. As younger generations are more familiar with technology, older generations losing their jobs may have a difficult time finding employment within the new jobs created as they are less familiar with the area. This generational gap was exemplified in the “learn to code’ meme that made its way across the internet in 2019 (The Ringer 2019). As jobs such as farming, mining and so on were being lost to automation, the people losing these jobs were encouraged by journalists and Mark Zuckerberg to learn to code as a means to employment. The criticism was that it would be very difficult to teach a person of a much older generation with experience in one field to learn to become a programmer with a background that did not provide them with any prior knowledge within the technology field. Some of these journalists later lost their jobs due to other circumstances, and the learn to code meme was spread as a way to mock them for their past suggestion that coal miners should learn to code, essentially telling journalists to learn to code as well.

The direct effects this technologies advancement could have on our team or others close by may come in the form of employment. As previously stated, though some jobs will be lost to automation, new jobs in the IT field, and in this case, particularly in cloud computing, will also be created. With many companies that are not even in the field of IT treating cloud computing as a necessity, with 90 percent of them employing the technology by 2024 as previously stated, this would mean exponential job growth and employment opportunities for those who are aiming to look for a career path in IT. As the push for smart cities grows, this technology could spread so far and wide that within a few years, most devices people carry will have some sort of connection with cloud technology. This means that the more abundant cloud technology becomes, the demand for more trained, skilled, and qualified people will increase. This could be in smart city infrastructure as previously stated, but also within cyber-security, commercial businesses and their IT infrastructure, government jobs, or the gaming industry with it’s continued push for cloud-based gaming.
