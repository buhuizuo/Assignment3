              </h2>
              <img src="cloud.png" alt="">
              <p>
                Cloud computing is essentially the concept that computing services such as storing information, running software, server usage and general computer tasks can be done via a cloud server (Microsoft 2021). The way this works is that a cloud services company sets up infrastructure on their end, while the end user can access their cloud and use their services via the internet. Some common examples of these are the Apple iCloud, or Google Drive. These two services offer online storage options for people. A simple way to think of these would be a hard drive that is constantly accessible online.
                <br><br>

Although many tend to think of cloud services as online storage, there are many other applications for cloud services, such as cloud computing which comes in the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) (SoftwareTestingHelp 2021). The IaaS infrastructure is focussed on storage, operating system usage, virtual machines, and networking. This type of infrastructure if often utilised by businesses for its advantages in developing online IT infrastructure, helping to reduce overhead costs. The SaaS infrastructure offers services that allow users to connect and use an application online. Many of Google’s apps use the SaaS infrastructure, as well as examples such as Dropbox or MailChimp, in addition to big business utilizing it for storefronts. The PaaS infrastructure is very much focussed on software development and is marketed particularly toward developers. It allows teams of developers to eliminate system maintenance, patches, security updates etc and provides a constantly stable platform where developers can focus on the creating side of development and reduce time. These are the most common infrastructures used in cloud computing, however there is also Desktop as a Service which allows desktop use over a network for the user, and GaaS, which is for games as a service. Though the latter sounds somewhat like other cloud computing infrastructures, it is important to note that it is more of a business model that tends to utilise SaaS infrastructure.
 <br><br>

According to LearnHub (2020), companies with one thousand employees or more are continuing to utilise cloud services, with up to 81 percent of these employing the technology. This is expected to grow to 90 percent by 2024. This could result in up to 75 percent of computing tasks for companies and organisations being done via a cloud service (LearnHub 2020). As an example of how cloud computing may be leveraged with future technology, quantum computing is already beginning to be utilised within the cloud computing field. Google and Microsoft have already begun to use this technology, and although it is early, the speed at which processing occurs with these powerful machines means the end result is a significant increase in efficiency or production (LearnHub 2020). Other possibilities in future for cloud services include the IoT, or Internet of all Things, Artificial Intelligence growth, digital infrastructure for smart cities via the cloud as population growth increases, and more immediately, serverless architecture. In essence, a serverless infrastructure determines the needs of a developer, and provides the infrastructure needed to support applications. This could be utilized in such a way that developers could divide software into parts and upload it onto the cloud depending on a client’s needs (LearnHub 2020). Although the technology within cloud services is likely to develop further such as leveraging the power of quantum computing, the real tangible advancements are not so much in the technology, but rather what the results of this technology can provide.
<br><br>

One area that is very likely to be impacted by cloud technology is automation. As has happened during the last century, the invention of new technology has often seen a reduction in jobs as the human worker would be replaced by an automated machine. In recent years, self-serve checkouts in supermarkets have been a common example of this.
<br><br>
As is often done, this results in media articles about machines taking away peoples jobs and creates a narrative that jobs will eventually not be abundant enough to support employment of the population. However, what is often not mentioned is that while certain jobs are lost, the creation of these new technologies often creates new jobs as well. In a study conducted in the U.K, it was found that 800,000 thousand jobs had been lost due to the rise of automation, however in the process, 3.5 million jobs had also been created (SensrTrx 2019), resulting in an overall gain of jobs being created. The caveat here though, is that the jobs lost were low-skilled jobs, while the jobs created required more specialised skills or training to perform. This could possibly be a contributing factor in the “digital divide” which refers to the gap in technological knowledge between demographics, commonly age. As younger generations are more familiar with technology, older generations losing their jobs may have a difficult time finding employment within the new jobs created as they are less familiar with the area. This generational gap was exemplified in the “learn to code’ meme that made its way across the internet in 2019 (The Ringer 2019). As jobs such as farming, mining and so on were being lost to automation, the people losing these jobs were encouraged by journalists and Mark Zuckerberg to learn to code as a means to employment. The criticism was that it would be very difficult to teach a person of a much older generation with experience in one field to learn to become a programmer with a background that did not provide them with any prior knowledge within the technology field. Some of these journalists later lost their jobs due to other circumstances, and the learn to code meme was spread as a way to mock them for their past suggestion that coal miners should learn to code, essentially telling journalists to learn to code as well.
<br><br>
The direct effects this technologies advancement could have on our team or others close by may come in the form of employment. As previously stated, though some jobs will be lost to automation, new jobs in the IT field, and in this case, particularly in cloud computing, will also be created. With many companies that are not even in the field of IT treating cloud computing as a necessity, with 90 percent of them employing the technology by 2024 as previously stated, this would mean exponential job growth and employment opportunities for those who are aiming to look for a career path in IT. As the push for smart cities grows, this technology could spread so far and wide that within a few years, most devices people carry will have some sort of connection with cloud technology. This means that the more abundant cloud technology becomes, the demand for more trained, skilled, and qualified people will increase. This could be in smart city infrastructure as previously stated, but also within cyber-security, commercial businesses and their IT infrastructure, government jobs, or the gaming industry with it’s continued push for cloud-based gaming.

              Machine Learning
              </h2>
              <img src="MachineLearning.png" alt="">
              <p>
                Machine learning at its core is the function of computers being able to learn and make predictions when they are given data (Heath 2020). Although machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI), it does differ somewhat from traditional AI methods. Typically, an AI would have much more explicit programming and perform functions based on this programming. The goal here was to have the AI try to behave as a human being would when performing tasks such as solving problems, reasoning, or logic. While machine learning can perform these tasks also, the difference is in how the machine knows how to do these functions. Machine learning will of course have developers and designers, but instead of being explicitly programmed to behave in a certain manner, it is simply fed information and data, and the learning process takes place from there. This can happen through a process called evolutionary computation (Heath 2020). Much like biological evolution, the computer will undergo random mutations in code until it has achieved an optimal set of code or algorithms that benefit it most. This means that the computers advancements require minimal human activity.
                <br><br>

There are two primary ways that machine learning occurs. This is always through the presentation of data to the computer, but there are some key differences. One way machine learning takes place is through supervised learning (Algorithmia 2020). When machine learning happens through this method, the computer is presented with a set of data. This data has labels attached to it that are predestined by the developers and is known as a training set. When presented with a training set, the machine learning that takes place will be more guided or specific. For example, if a set of letters were fed to the machine, and each of these letters were assigned a label, over a period and with enough examples, the computer would slowly begin to be able to recognise these letters without the need for the attached labels. The learning that will have taken place is the recognition of these letters. The other type of machine learning is called unsupervised learning. This differs from supervised learning primarily in the sense that the data being fed to the computer is not annotated. There are no labels attached to the data set, so the computer does not have as much guidance here. What occurs in this instance is that instead of trying to match annotations to a piece of data, the computer itself will attempt to find patterns and recognise them within the data that has been fed to it. Usually this can be useful in instances when looking for similarities, such as if one were to search for motels within a given city.
 <br><br>

Given that machine learning has already begun to advance, it is easy to see it playing a bigger part in future. A sector where machine learning is growing exponentially is in big business. To illustrate the growth it has head within the business sector, the market for machine learning is expected to reach over $8 billion by the year 2022 (Rose 2020). This is likely to grow even further as unsupervised machine learning becomes more advanced. Since supervised machine learning has somewhat of a known outcome, it can require more human attention. With unsupervised machine learning becoming more advanced and able to recognise patterns in data sets more easily, this will require less human supervision. The benefit here is that businesses will be able to utilize unsupervised machine learning to do more of the leg work, requiring less man hours and more work done on behalf of computers. According to Rose (2020), companies like Google, Amazon and other large corporations are already beginning to capitalize on this and it is being done by a combination of machine learning and quantum computing. Quantum computing simply offers a much faster rate of processing data, while mixed with unsupervised machine learning, this process of learning will occur much faster. Big businesses could leverage this in constant analysis of their data and utilize it in marketing, profits, predicted outcomes and so on.
<br><br>
With the advancements in machine learning AI and quantum computing combined with it, this is likely to effect certain jobs in the years to come. Much like the advancements of automation in certain industries, this will likely replace some workers, but a level of supervision by humans will still be needed. According to Hubspot (2019), a competent AI is already able to analyse sales calls faster than a human sales manager. This could obviously lead to machine learning being used to constantly analyse sales data and manipulate initiatives by companies to increase their profit margins. Additionally, some other occupations that may affect human employment could include reception or admin, research analysts, retail, telemarketing, and advertising. However, much like cloud computing affecting the job market, there may also be a rise in jobs in other sectors as the new technology will still require human interaction, even with unsupervised machine learning. Hubspot also states that there will be careers that will remain unaffected by this technology such as graphic designers, executive officers, software development, writers, and editors. It would seem that while creative jobs in the past have been tougher markets to break into, they may see a rise in availability as AI takes a higher position within industries that require automation. In effect, while some jobs may be lost, others may be created, or atleast see opportunities rise in other sectors that have traditionally had a much lower demand, such as industries requiring human creativity which may still be far away for AI to be able to replicate.
<br><br>
As someone who has worked extensively within graphic design and illustration, this could result in a positive for people in similar areas. When the global financial crisis hit in 2007, creative industries suffered a lot. Even creative industries that were somewhat more accessible such as business oriented graphic design. Many larger corporations shut their in-house design departments and resorted to commissioning freelance designers when needed. If AI continues to advance where, this may actually help in reviving industries that never fully recovered from the financial crisis. Many saw these jobs as the first point of sacrifice within their companies. With machine learning much more viable now, it could help reduce costs as they would not need to way wages for jobs that are covered by automation, further encouraging them to embrace areas within their business that require more human creative solutions which computers are still quite far behind in replicating.

              <h2>
              Cryptocurrencies
              </h2>
                <img src="Cryptocurrencies.png" alt="">    
              <h4>
            What do cryptocurrencies do?
            </h4>
              <p>
                Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that can be used to make transfers and purchases much the same as money but with key differences. The main differences between cryptocurrencies and money are that cryptocurrencies are exclusively digital, they are not governed or legislated by any one country and their value is dependent on what the public is willing to pay for them. Another key difference is that not everybody has jumped on board with cryptocurrencies yet meaning that only a very small handful of companies will accept cryptocurrencies as payment for goods or services. Where as cash is accepted almost anywhere
                <br><br>

There are many different cryptocurrencies the most common is known as ‘Bitcoin’, bitcoin uses ‘blockchain’ technology to record transactions and the ownership of Bitcoins. Simply put, every time someone transfers or purchases something with bitcoins a new space in memory or ‘block’ is added to the ‘blockchain’ which is the database for every bitcoin transaction ever made. Interestingly this information is accessible to the public but is heavily guarded by cryptographic code.
 <br><br>
The bitcoin process is not instant, initially a bitcoin transaction is put on a list of recent transactions waiting to be compiled and added to the chain. The people who add blocks to the chain are known as ‘miners’ they solve the cryptographic code of the transaction, after this other miner’s check the solution and come to an agreement and add the compiled block of transactions to the chain. This is usually completed in under an hour.
<br><br>
In Summary cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to commonly practiced investment methods such as the stock market, term deposits or banking with a regulated financial institution. I think we are yet to see the full potential of cryptocurrencies and when there is a bit less uncertainty around it then more people will get involved.
<br><br>
<h4>
What do cryptocurrencies do?
</h4>
In my opinion these unregulated cryptocurrency organisations are sort of like a test run for countries and governments to see if they will adopt the practice with their own country’s currency. If these companies like bitcoin continue to succeed then governments will start integrating cryptocurrency into their legitimate currency by introducing a digital dollar and some might even eradicate cash completely.
<br><br>
Australia was one of the first countries to start partly accepting cryptocurrency as legal tender back in 2017, this is a good step for us as a country as it gives us an early chance to start integrating cryptocurrencies with the correct regulations and security measures that the government can provide. It is highly likely that cryptocurrencies will eventually be integrated into most official currencies worldwide with some becoming completely cash free.
<br><br>
As of now cryptocurrencies are mostly used by investors as a part of their portfolio and not frequently used by an Australian on an average income. Some say that cryptocurrencies will only keep increasing, some say that their crash is inevitable but it is safe to say that some lucky people have made lots of money through things like Bitcoin. An example of a bitcoin success story is that of Kristofer Koch from Norway. He was writing a thesis on bitcoin and though he might as well make a small investment of 150 kroner (around 35 Australian dollars). Years later after hearing about the bitcoin boom Kristofer battled with remembering his password but eventually got into his account and was greeted with about 5 million Kroner (around 1.1 million Australian dollars).
<br><br>
How will cryptocurrencies affect me?
</h4>
  <p>
    With Australia being one of the first countries to start accepting cryptocurrencies as legal tender I think there is a good chance that Australia could be one of the first countries to go completely cash-less. This would mean that the Australian dollar would essentially in a way become a cryptocurrency itself. This concept divides people with some being sceptical about the lack of privacy involved with a cashless society and others keen on the practicality and convenience of the idea.
    <br><br>
The positives of a cashless society would be a decrease is crime and money laundering as there is no physical money to be stolen or laundered, easier currency exchange when travelling and the ability to pay exact amounts. On the other hand the negatives of a cashless society are that it is completely reliant on technology and the internet, you can be vulnerable to hackers, it can lead to poor spending habits and the elderly will find it hard to keep up with a cashless society. Around 74% of people over the age of 55 don’t even use banking apps.
<br><br>
If I cashless society were to occur in Australia, I personally would not be too affected, as a young person I have been using cashless forms of payments since I opened my first bank account so the change would be minor. It does concern me a little bit that every single transaction made will be recorded and there will be no way of making a completely anonymous purchase or paying someone in cash. For example, a grandma will no longer be able to pay her grandson 10 dollars to mow the lawn and you won’t be able to lend your friend a 50 dollar note if his phone is dead. Another example of a negative is sometimes people might need to buy medication they find embarrassing and will not be able to do it completely anonymously.  <br><br>
<br>
In summary I am not concerned about the effect that cryptocurrencies can have on me in the long run because I am almost a cashless person myself, but it is certainly going to affect a very large percentage of the world if things become increasingly cashless. Steps must be taken to make sure everyone is included in the change to digital money.
