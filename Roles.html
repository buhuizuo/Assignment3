<h3>
  Backend developers
</h3>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backend developer is responsible for everything that is under the hood of the application, and they are your chief problem-solvers. make sure product has an efficient, yet powerful engine. They plan and develop the whole application architecture, decide which services and databases should communicate together, how API and external integrations should work and how to make sure the product is secure and stable. <br>
They are consultants, not just coders.  A good backend developer not only implements what they are told to but also looks for the most efficient ways to solve a given problem. For example, if you ask your BE developer to implement a particular database, and the developer knows a different solution will work better for your app, they will surely convince you to consider another option. Sometimes the idea you have might be time-consuming to implement but the same effect can be delivered faster using a different approach – backend devs will know it.
