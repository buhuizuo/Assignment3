          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our team has 2 members only so far, we basically both need to be project manager, product designer and developer ect. if in the future we are able to hire more people or recruit more members, we’ll separate roles, so we can all focus on our own task, here is a table of specific roles with different members and what exactly the role need to do.

                  Project manager
                </h4>
                <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project manager is a person responsible for managing and leading the whole team. Their role is to efficiently optimise the work of the team, ensure the product is meeting the requirements and identify the goals for the team. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>
                  Software architect 
                </h4>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software architect is a highly-skilled software developer that has to think through all the aspects of the project and is responsible for making high level design choices, as well as select technical standards (for instance, determines the technology stack to use).

<h4>
  Frontend Developer
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frontend developer creates the part of your application that the users see and directly interact with. They make sure the experience is equally smooth and user-friendly to every person who uses the app.  
The quality of literally everything your user interacts with depends on the skills of your frontend developers. The hardest part of their job is to make sure every single user gets the same experience – whether they use Edge or Chrome, computer or phone, Android or iOS. Frontend developers are trained to be browser charmers and masters of resolutions backend developer, Chief Technological Problem Solver.
It’s the person who writes complex and sophisticated algorithms and application logic that makes all the magic happen under the hood. 
</p>
<br />
<h4>
  Backend developers
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backend developer is responsible for everything that is under the hood of the application, and they are your chief problem-solvers. make sure product has an efficient, yet powerful engine. They plan and develop the whole application architecture, decide which services and databases should communicate together, how API and external integrations should work and how to make sure the product is secure and stable. <br>
They are consultants, not just coders.  A good backend developer not only implements what they are told to but also looks for the most efficient ways to solve a given problem. For example, if you ask your BE developer to implement a particular database, and the developer knows a different solution will work better for your app, they will surely convince you to consider another option. Sometimes the idea you have might be time-consuming to implement but the same effect can be delivered faster using a different approach – backend devs will know it. 
</p>

<h4>Quality Assurance Engineer</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QA Engineers make sure that your application is bug-free, has adequate support across all devices/browsers, and meets all the requirements.they spot the bugs and problems before your users do. While testing your application, QA specialist pays attention to performance, security, usability, portability, and looks of the application from the end-user perspective. They are not just testers, they make sure implemented features meet the requirements (which they help to describe beforehand anyway), write documentation, create test cases, and proactively contribute to establishing the best development practices in the project. Their role is critical in delivering the high-quality product, seamless end-user experience and fulfilment of project requirements. In the long run, not only are they time-savers, but also irreplaceable headache-savers.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Product Designer</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Designers help you to transform your product vision into user-friendly designs and create user journeys optimised for the best user experience and highest conversion rates.
Application development team roles require Product Designers. They are key players in making sure the product you build succeeds. People tend to think of them as graphic artists that create nice looking designs. While it’s true, Product Designers make sure the feel and look of your application and the overall user interface is as sharp and eye-pleasing as possible, it’s not their only responsibility. They will be your team members through the whole development process, from translating your business goals into functional user experiences, to analysing, evaluating and enhancing those experiences over time. 
</p>
<br />
<h4>Business Analyst(user requirement)</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make sure you are building the right product at right time to solve the right problem, and that it’s in line with your overall business model and client’s expectations. Research shows that if 8 to 15% of the time and funds are spent on business analysis, then chances for project success grow significantly. A Business Analyst helps you to craft a product vision and create requirements based on your customers and stakeholders needs and later help you in validating if you are on the right track.
