          <h4>Dane Goulter</h4>
          <h4>Student Number: s3578854 </h4>
          <p>
      Dane Goulter is a graphic designer and illustrator currently residing in Melbourne. His hobbies include art and design both traditionally and digitally, in addition to a life long interest in martial arts. Experience within the field of IT includes graphic design and scree/media-oriented work. This includes experience working with programs such as Adobe’s Creative Suite, e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier etc, as well as some experience with Adobe Flash using ActionScript, though quite a few years ago. Dane also has some experience within building PC’s which began at a younger age tinkering with broken PCs to repair them, which later turned into PC building. This hobby eventually turned to an interest in more software-oriented fields such as programming, software development and exploring other fields within the IT industry. After having looked into different area’s of IT, Dane has developed an interest in the area of cloud computing. Given that it is a growing industry and becoming more prominent in our everyday lives, this may be an industry that he works towards working in.

            <br>
            <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics </h4>
            <p>
            In the 16 personalities test, Dane was graded as that of an INFP-T, or a mediator. This personality type has a strong emphasis on individualism and creative expression. This also coincides with a creativity test in which Dane achieved a score of 62/80, indicating creativity to be a strong characteristic. This was further supported by results indicating that Dane’s style of learning is at it is best when done in a visual and tactile fashion. With these test results in mind, it may be most beneficial for him to work in fields where creativity, design, or exploration of new ideas are a priority. With experience in graphic design and illustration, these elements could be combined.

            <h4>Wei Cui</h4>
            <h4>Student Number: s3903904 </h4>
            <p>Wei Cui was born in China. After travelling on a working holiday, Wei decided to stay in Australia to study. This came after having achieved a bachelor’s degree in animation, in which Wei worked and gained experience in the field over a span of ten years. Much of this experience came in the form of working in animation specifically for cartoons on television and online games. Some of Wei’s hobbies include watching cartoons and animation, reading and collecting comic books, and having travelled extensively to countries including Russia, Iran, Thailand, Laos, and New Zealand. An interest in IT developed for Wei while working for an online gaming company. Upon listening to the developers and testers discuss their work, conversations began on the topic and further interest in the field developed, which lead Wei to grow an interest specifically within the field of software development.

              <br>
              <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics</h4>
              <p>
                Having testedon the 16 personalities test as having that of an ISFP-A personality, this would indicate that Wei can work well both independently and within a team environment. People with this type of personality tend to contribute toteam environments in very practical ways and are very often prepared to accommodate other members  of the team. They also tend to enjoy problem solving, but also being able to see real results from their work, which they also tend to favour being hands on and practical. These strengths of being both individual but being able to work with a team, in addition to having a focus on tangible results makes Wei  a  versatile  team  memberthat  could  be  suited  to  a  variety  of  roles. Combined  with an interest in exploring ideas and going against the grain, this can also make Wei suited to areas where innovation and new ways of thinking are paramount.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any group project relies upon group members working together, there were some small changes made. Assignment 2 was able to be completed through the team members having a variety of skills, meaning that different sections were applicable to all team members. This did work out well, however with the third assignment, some things changed. Wei did well in implementing the web design functions in assessment 2, and has continued to do so with the third assessment. With sections regarding specifics in regards to the project overview, roles have been decided based upon knowledge for the most part. As the project is about designing a digital Webster-Pak, which was originally an idea Dane had, things regarding very specific areas about this have been assigned to Dane as he may have more insight into the idea. This is in regard to areas such as the planning and progress, aims, and risks. It was also decided that Dane would focus a lot on the video presentation, having had some experience with video editing. Wei has been assigned areas that may be a little more technical, having recently done a large portion of the web design and GitHub work, this seemed most fitting. Specifically, Wei has been working on areas regarding testing, tools, timeframe, and the scope and limits of the project.

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout Dane’s recent studies, there has been a focus on many different areas of IT. Although initially interested in programming, these recent studies have created interest in other areas of IT for Dane. Particularly, the realisation of the rise of cloud computing, which also ties into other areas such as AI and machine learning. Although programming can still be required for these areas, this continuously growing industry may be an area Dane looks forward to in the future but will still keep an open mind to develop new ideas or goals towards different IT fields.

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei has continued to develop interest within the area of programming and coding. Having previously worked in animation, Wei was inspired to look into programming after hearing co-workers discuss it. Having studied programming a little so far, this has allowed Wei to develop programming skills which will be a good foundation to refining these skills in the future to become a more proficient programmer.
