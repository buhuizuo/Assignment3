          <h4>Dane Goulter</h4>
          <h4>Student Number: s3578854 </h4>
          <p>
            Dane Goulter is a graphic designer and illustrator currently residing in Melbourne. His hobbies include art and design both traditionally and digitally, in addition to a lifelonginterest in  martial  arts. Experience  within  the  field  of  IT  includesgraphic  design  and  scree/media-orientedwork.  This  includes  experience  working  with  programs  such  as Adobe’s Creative Suite, e.g.,Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier etc, as well as some experience with Adobe Flash using  ActionScript,  though  quite  a  few  years  ago.  Dane  also  has  some  experience  within building PC’s which began at a younger age tinkering with broken PCstorepairthem, which later turned into PC building. This hobby eventually turned to an interest in more software-oriented fields such as programming, software development and exploring other fields within the IT industry.

            <br>
            <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics</h4>
            <p>
            In the 16 personalities test, Dane was graded as that of an INFP-T, or a mediator. This personality  type  has  a  strong  emphasis  on  individualism  and  creative  expression. This  also coincides with a creativity test in which Dane achieved a score of 62/80, indicating creativity to be a strong characteristic. This was furthersupported by results indicating that Dane’s style of learning is at it isbest when done in a visual and tactile fashion. With these test results in mind,  it  may  be  most  beneficialfor  him  to  work  in  fields  where  creativity,  design,  or exploration  of  new  ideas  are  a  priority. With  experience  in  graphic  design  and  illustration, these elements could be combined.

            <h4>Wei Cui</h4>
            <h4>Student Number: s3903904 </h4>
            <p>
              ei Cui was born in China. After travelling on a working holiday, Wei decided to stay in  Australia  to  study. This  came  after  having  achieved  a bachelor’sdegree  in  animation,  in which Wei worked and gained experience in the fieldover a span often years. Much of this experience came in the form of working in animation specifically for cartoons on television and online games. Some of Wei’s hobbies include watching cartoons and animation, reading and  collecting  comic  books,  and  having  travelled  extensively to  countries  including  Russia, Iran, Thailand, Laos, and New Zealand.An interest in IT developed for Wei while working for an online gaming company. Upon listening to the developers and testers discusstheir work, conversations began on the topic and further interest in the field developed, which lead Wei to grow an interest specifically within the field of software development.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics</h4>
              <p>
                Having testedon the 16 personalities test as having that of an ISFP-A personality, this would indicate that Wei can work well both independently and within a team environment. People with this type of personality tend to contribute toteam environments in very practical ways and are very often prepared to accommodate other members  of the team. They also tend to enjoy problem solving, but also being able to see real results from their work, which they also tend to favour being hands on and practical. These strengths of being both individual but being able to work with a team, in addition to having a focus on tangible results makes Wei  a  versatile  team  memberthat  could  be  suited  to  a  variety  of  roles. Combined  with an interest in exploring ideas and going against the grain, this can also make Wei suited to areas where innovation and new ways of thinking are paramount.

          <h4>Byron Kitchener</h4>
          <h4>Student Number: s3910912 </h4>
          <p>
          Byron Kitchener currently resides in Tweed, NSW. Some of his hobbies include gaming, surfing, and working out in the gym. An interest in IT has also developed which has ledto him currently pursuing his studies within the IT field. Although it is early, Byron has already gained some  experience  within  the  Python  programming  languageand  is  already  adept  at  basic computing.  Furthermore,  an  interest  in  building  a  gaming  PCpushed  him  to  learn  and understand the fundamental’s of building a PC, such as components, compatibility, operating system  installation  and  so  on. This  interest  as  a  hobby  which  helped  him  gain hands  on experienceis what has encouraged Byron to pursue a career within the field of IT. Although he  is  keeping  his  options  open  to  various  areas,  the  focus  for  Byron  is  currently onprogramming.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics</h4>
            <p>
              In the Myers Briggs test, Byron’s result indicated that he has the personality type ofaISTJ-A, or an assertive logistician. As the name would indicate, logisticians often emphasize logic when problem solving or devising solutions. This is also combined with a tendency to be very observant and through, emphasizing a need to have all the  facts, information,or data before coming to a conclusionor decision. The results of this test are strengthened by Byron’s results  in  the  Oxford  College  learning  type  quiz,  which  is  that  of  a  reflector.  Reflectors  are extremely likea logistician;in that they prefer to analyse and have all the information to make informed  decisions. Byron  also  took  a  sample  aptitude  test  for  the  ADF,  scoring  a  total  of 80/100. This testdoes contain questions which are often very problem solving oriented, and sometimes trick questions. Allthese results would suggest that Byron can excel in areas where firm  data  analysis,  information  andthrough  investigation  are  required  to  gain  the  best possible results.

            <h4>Zain Khan</h4>
            <h4>Student Number: s3910934 </h4>
            <p>
              Zain Khan was born in New Zealand butmoved to Australia at a young age with his parents. Having  grown  up  in  a  country  with  access  to  modern  technology,  this  instilled  a  mentality  of  the importance of access to technology today. Much of Zain’s interest in IT has stemmed from an interest in  competitive  online  games,  which  also  extends  to  a  competitive  interest  in  his  hobby  of  playing soccer. Although without much experience yet, Zain is currently studying IT togain knowledge and experience in hopes of leading himself into a career within the IT field. Zain’s interest in games has helped him to develop an interest specifically in artificial intelligence (AI)and programming languages. As  his  father  also  worked  within  the  field  of  IT,  Zain  was  able  to  gain  valuable  knowledge  in  the application of HTML and the creation of websites.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Strengths, learning, and characteristics</h4>
              <p>
                After  having  taken  the  Myers  Briggs  test,  Zain  returned  a  result  of  INTP-T. This personality type is often found within the IT field, and often recommend to people with this personality  type  to  work  in  technology.  They  tend  to  favour thinking,  intellectual  pursuits, analysing, anddeep understanding of any given task tocreate solutions. They also tend to be open minded to new ideas or alternatives, so long as this information is supported and sound. Although they may second guess themselves and some can see this as a weakness, it could also be seen as a strength in that they are questioning themselves and being through. Zain’s learning style results also indicate that he is very much a tactile learner, meaning hands on experience and practical application benefit his progress most of all. The combination of all these  traits  could  suggest  that  Zain  may  excel  in  positions  where  thinking  abstractly  about problem  solving,  analysing  the  possibilities  andunderstanding  all  aspects  of  any  given situation will allow him to either complete the task at hand in a logical fashion, or create and entirely new solutionaltogether.
