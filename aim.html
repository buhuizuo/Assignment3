              <h4>
              Central Goal
            </h4>
                <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary, overarching goal is to create an app that functions as a digital Webster-Pak. Although the app will contain other functions that will be detailed below, this is our first and most primary intended function. The easiest way to visualise this is to think of a physical Webster-Pak. What does it do? What is its purpose? How does it function and why is it necessary? These questions are what will help us in understanding how to understand how we should translate the answers to these questions in a digital format. At its core, a physical Webster-Pak is a medication scheduling idea that helps maintain medication adherence. The goal is to take this idea, translate it to a digital device, then take advantage of what a digital device can do which a physical Webster-Pak cannot.   <br>
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Usability
                </h4>
                <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously outlined, easy usability is a goal for us that is almost as important as the central goal itself. Many people in our society that have a high number of medications are often the elderly. This also happens to be the demographic in our society that suffers most from the “digital divide”. This digital divide essentially means that having not grown up with technology being so prominent, a lot of the elderly users have a more difficult time interfacing with modern technology such as computers or smart devices. We want to design an app that helps eliminate this problem, where the user interface is large, bold, and simple in its design. Too much clutter could confuse these users. In addition to this, the labelling and functional use would also be designed in a simple way. We would like this simplicity to be effective enough that the user interface is almost self-explanatory, much like ticking a box on a physical piece of paper. However, this also means that we need to be mindful of implementing too many functions. Too much choice and options may be overwhelming for these users, so limiting functions is also a part of the design.
                </p>
                <h4>
                Eliminate Financial Burden
                </h4>
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This goal is also very much centred on the elderly, but also for users that may suffer from disabilities and in turn have resulted in limited incomes. The app requires not other additional costs. No subscription with a pharmacist is required, nor is the purchase of any other devices required. Alternatives such as e-Pill Timecaps add a financial cost to the user. As stated, many users have limited incomes and these alternatives can become expensive extremely quickly. The aim of this app is to eliminate this financial overhead.
<h4>
Reminders
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to implement a reminder or alarm function for the app. As a physical Webster-Pak aims to build medication adherence, it also can not produce any kind of reminder. It relies solely upon the user remembering their Webster-Pak and adhering to the schedule indicated. The app would introduce a reminder function so that when it indicates a medication needs to be taken, the user can tick it off as being taken. If it has not been checked, the alarm will intermittently sound off until it has been checked off. This is one of the ways that this digital Webster-Pak can work in conjunction with a physical version of it.
</p>
<h4>
Logs and History
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not expressly part of the primary goal, a history of medication and changes could also be implemented, though it could be optional also, or automatically logged when medications have been input into the app. The purpose for this would be one that medical professionals use. For example, if a user has been admitted to hospital, or changes GP, they will be able to produce this history and provide it to those medical professionals. This could help eliminate time spent searching for records, and possibly help if a user has an allergy to a medication as it could also be recorded here.
