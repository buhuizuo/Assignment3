              Topic
            </h4>
                <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for this project is based within the health industry. In short, the concept is to create an app that essentially functions as a type of digital Webster-Pak. This could work either as a standalone app, or in conjunction with a user’s physical Webster-Pak. The app may possibly function as a chatbot, a traditional app, or perhaps a combination of both. It would allow users to input medications, dosage amounts, scheduling of when to take medication, reminders, and logs.
          <br>
          This app will also be designed with being very user friendly in mind. As many users may be elderly, the digital divide is an area of concern, as such, developing the app to be as user friendly as possible to the point where it is almost intuitive should be focussed on. This is because we want to maintain a high retention rate of users. If it is too complex, they may not use it at all. As such, user friendliness is not just a consideration for the app, but more so a part of the design itself.
                </p>
                <h4>
                Motivation
                </h4>
                <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary motivation for this project came from witnessing those that have a high number of prescriptions, and the primary goal behind physical Webster-Pak’s. The idea for a physical Webster-Pak is that it helps patients adhere to their medications on a schedule that has been prescribed to them by a medical professional. Physical Webster-Pak’s have existed for quite awhile and have proved effectivity in maintain medication adherence. As the world becomes more technologically inclined, it seems fitting that a digital version of this idea would inevitably exist. Almost everyone has some sort of digital smart device these days, such as a smart phone or iPad. We use them for banking, paying bills, public transport tickets and so on, all of which have been done in a more physical sense before being digitally converted. The benefit here is that it would possibly allow for a GP or medical professional to be able to add in prescriptions for users, making a kind of on-the-spot Webster-Pak without the need to wait for a pharmacist to make them. In addition to this, it would also keep a record of medications, and changes that have happened over time, something that a physical Webster-Pak can not do. Often there can be confusion when a patient is admitted to hospital when they need a record of a patient’s past medications. This app could prove useful in that regard also.
                </p>
                <h4>
                Landscape
                </h4>
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are similar apps or devices that exist, but none that have been found so far that quite meet the needs we are looking to provide. As previously stated, user friendly interfaces are extremely important here. Most apps that exist in the medical field are majorly aimed toward medical professionals, and not the patient. There are also physical devices, such as electronic caps that can be placed on a bottle and have timers or let a user know when the bottle was last opened. However, these devices can quickly add up and become very expensive. A single e-Pill Timecap can cost around $60 AUD. This is for a single cap. With how many medications some patients have, the cost can add up very quickly. A user with 7 prescriptions would be looking at a $420 investment here. This is extremely difficult especially for those that are elderly, on a aged pension or limited incomes. These caps often do not fit many bottles as well, so additionally, e-Pill Timecap bottles may need to be purchased, and then transfer pills to the bottle, adding more time and fiddling. There are also alternatives that pay a subscription to a pharmacist, and the user is provided with a device that functions like a Webster-Pak, where the pill compartment only opens at a specific time. This also can become expensive as it requires a subscription, the initial cost of prescriptions, plus purchasing the device. Our idea for this app is to eliminate these costs. There would be no need to purchase any separate devices, plus it works in conjunction with physical Webster-Pak’s, unlike some other alternatives.
