          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our group should have 6 members. As soon as the grouping was confirmed, we immediately sent email to everyone, with our personal profile, Ms team link and Ms team use guide link attached. We are looking forward to share ideas and complete assignment together. we only had Wei, Dane, Byron and Zain replied. later we sent emails to other 2 from time to time, looking forward to reply, but  Cameron Jones, Kadin seal never replied. so four members joined MS team. Zain Khan appeared once in MS team. After receiving the task, he never replied. Only Wei Cui, Byron Kitchener and Dane Goulter completed assignment 2 together. We used Ms team to send the completed documents, exchange ideas and organize meetings. We held meetings about twice a week, It took about half an hour to discuss what needs to be completed, how to complete it, and who will do which part. This cooperation process is very pleasant. team members understand and encourage each other, and help each other to complete assignment  to the maximum extent. We also add each other's Messenger, and sometimes communicate on the messenger too.
<br><br>Byron Kitchener no longer reachable when it came to assignment 3. We tried to send messages and emails to his Messenger, We also tried to find him on MS team but he didn't reply, so Dane and Wei could only work together to complete assignment 3. We held meetings twice a week in MS team to discuss how to complete the assignment, Set out the key points and allocate the workload, report the progress of the work completed after the last meeting, and plan the next work. Each meeting is about half an hour. After a very pleasant discussion, Dane will mark everyone's work in the task.
