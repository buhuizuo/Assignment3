              <h4>
              Central Goal
            </h4>
                <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary, overarching goal is to create an app that functions as a digital Webster-Pak. Although the app will contain other functions that will be detailed below, this is our first and most primary intended function. The easiest way to visualise this is to think of a physical Webster-Pak. What does it do? What is its purpose? How does it function and why is it necessary? These questions are what will help us in understanding how to understand how we should translate the answers to these questions in a digital format. At its core, a physical Webster-Pak is a medication scheduling idea that helps maintain medication adherence. The goal is to take this idea, translate it to a digital device, then take advantage of what a digital device can do which a physical Webster-Pak cannot.   <br>
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Usability
                </h4>
                <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously outlined, easy usability is a goal for us that is almost as important as the central goal itself. Many people in our society that have a high number of medications are often the elderly. This also happens to be the demographic in our society that suffers most from the “digital divide”. This digital divide essentially means that having not grown up with technology being so prominent, a lot of the elderly users have a more difficult time interfacing with modern technology such as computers or smart devices. We want to design an app that helps eliminate this problem, where the user interface is large, bold, and simple in its design. Too much clutter could confuse these users. In addition to this, the labelling and functional use would also be designed in a simple way. We would like this simplicity to be effective enough that the user interface is almost self-explanatory, much like ticking a box on a physical piece of paper. However, this also means that we need to be mindful of implementing too many functions. Too much choice and options may be overwhelming for these users, so limiting functions is also a part of the design.
                </p>
                <h4>
                Eliminate Financial Burden
                </h4>
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This goal is also very much centred on the elderly, but also for users that may suffer from disabilities and in turn have resulted in limited incomes. The app requires not other additional costs. No subscription with a pharmacist is required, nor is the purchase of any other devices required. Alternatives such as e-Pill Timecaps add a financial cost to the user. As stated, many users have limited incomes and these alternatives can become expensive extremely quickly. The aim of this app is to eliminate this financial overhead.
<h4>
Reminders
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to implement a reminder or alarm function for the app. As a physical Webster-Pak aims to build medication adherence, it also can not produce any kind of reminder. It relies solely upon the user remembering their Webster-Pak and adhering to the schedule indicated. The app would introduce a reminder function so that when it indicates a medication needs to be taken, the user can tick it off as being taken. If it has not been checked, the alarm will intermittently sound off until it has been checked off. This is one of the ways that this digital Webster-Pak can work in conjunction with a physical version of it.
</p>
<h4>
Logs and History
</h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not expressly part of the primary goal, a history of medication and changes could also be implemented, though it could be optional also, or automatically logged when medications have been input into the app. The purpose for this would be one that medical professionals use. For example, if a user has been admitted to hospital, or changes GP, they will be able to produce this history and provide it to those medical professionals. This could help eliminate time spent searching for records, and possibly help if a user has an allergy to a medication as it could also be recorded here.
</p>

<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration for this app came from witnessing people with multiple medications forgetting, or having trouble maintaining adherence to medication schedules. In Australia, for mental health prescriptions alone, about 4.4 million people were prescribed medication for mental health conditions (Australian Institute of Health 2021). This equates to just over 17% of the Australian population, and that is for mental health medications alone. That is a significant number of the population for one area of health and could justify attempting to implement this app alone. However, to illustrate even more justification for why an app like this could be significantly useful to people, a study in 2018 showed that 9 million people in Australia take a prescribed medication per day, with 8 million of those consisting of multiple medications (NPS Medicine News 2018). That is around 32% of the population that are taking multiple medications per-day. While it is conceivable that some of these may only take two medications per-day, possibly eliminating the need for a Webster-Pak or digital Webster-Pak, it is also true that many people are taking more than two medications per-day. As these numbers increase, adherence to medications may become more difficult.  These statistics are also the inspiration behind the development of this app.
<br>
<p>The initial plan for the app is to first come up with a design document. The design document will contain various detailed aspects of the app, how it will function and so on. This will be more of a text based document, with diagrams showing app pages, what they link to, buttons and navigation. It will also contain details for each page in the app. The splash page of the app will contain large readable icons that take the user to whichever section they need to. These sections at this stage will likely be a scheduling page that will allow the user to input the medication, whether it is daily, weekly, or monthly, what time it will need to be taken, and whether it should be taken with food or not, and dosage. When the user inputs this data, it can automatically set up a reminder to sound off when the scheduled time comes. These reminders should be both visual and audio based, to accommodate for those who are both vision and hearing impaired. A system could also be implemented where a user is reminded that they need to have their prescription refilled.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Another section of the app will be a history log. This will automatically record each prescription the user has added over time, and all the details such as scheduling, how long it was taken for, when it began and so on. This information is intended also for medical professionals, so they have quick access to the user’s medication history.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A button on the splash page will also take users to a “Your Prescription” section. This page will be easily read and accessible and its purpose is to give a quick rundown of the user’s current medications, so they do not need to sort them out through the scheduling section of the app. It will be a quick list that can be readily accessed for when it is necessary.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Although not within the primary focus as of yet, we may also implement a Pharmacy section into the app. This would be a location-based service and would readily provide users with a list of pharmacies that are within their proximity. Ideally, availability of certain medications would be good to have, but at this stage may be quite a complex process to sort out, but a pharmacies list for users may still be useful none the less.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have also designed a visual mock-up for the user interface. As a user-friendly interface is important to our design, we think it is important that we have a visual design to reference from before the app development begins. This design mock-up will have page designs for each sections of the app such as the user inputting prescriptions, the pharmacies section, log and history etc. This will help each team member make sure that our design works coherently, as opposed to each member guessing.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
The idea for this app initially began as one that would function as a Chatbot. The idea was that the user would input a medication and the Chatbot would return a response based on the query, while also being able to input medication scheduling. While possible, after some research it seems that this may not be the most efficient approach. A Chatbot may still be implemented, but functionally different than before. It could be used to query for example. However, it appears that creating a schedule for medications would be far more effective by creating a section in the app that would likely also implement some sort of calendar to show upcoming medications as well as functions to input the various details required for each prescription such as timing, dosage, with or without food etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
For the app development tool, we are most likely to use the development software Appypie. This tool is designed to be able create apps for Android, iPhone, and a web page-based app. It does not require any coding skills so is an easier option to begin with. This may change though as there are many different software development tools and some may offer better options than others. This service also helps to take care of publishing the app on Google Play store and Apple’s app store. This also comes with a fee though, more so in Apple’s case as they have increased prices for developers to punlish their apps on the Apple store. The Appypie software also requires a subscription, so overall there are some overhead costs. Ideally, in future when team members are more experienced with coding, we could eliminate the costs by foregoing the use of Appypie and other easy-to-make app software and create it ourselves. This would eliminate some costs, leaving only the publishing costs on each respective platform.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The project overall may be an on-going one that is continuously improved upon. As a basic initial test and to make things simpler, the app could first be tested as a reminder for those who take insulin. This would be only one medication obviously, but with the same principle but limiting complexity early on so as to serve as a kind of test to see if it is a useful tool for people to use. After this, it could be expanded upon to allow for including various different prescriptions with reminders and other aspects previously detailed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The main drive behind this app however remains as a useful tool for those on prescriptions that need assistance adhering to it. Three quarters of those between the ages of 50 to 64 use various prescription medications, while up to 91% of those above the age of 80 use medications (Health policy Institute n.d.). As this is the demographic that are the most effected by the digital divide, we think this will likely be the demographic that will find the most use with this app. This has highly influenced the design decision to make the app as user friendly as possible, to a point where someone with very little experience with technology could intuitively figure it out.
