              <h2>
                Andy Sterkowitz: Software Developer
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Software developer Andy Sterkowitz made this video to give an explanation of the most common practices of his profession. He breaks it up into 5 general steps, the first step is usually an organisation will ask him to build a feature in their app or website, he uses the hypothetical scenario of Twitter asking for a ‘poke’ button (same as facebook) as an example of something that could be requested. He explains that he himself is a ‘full stack developer’ which means for such a job he would be responsible for everything from the database or ‘back end ’ side of the things to the more graphical/user input side of things or ‘front end ’.
  The second step is bug fixing, no matter how well the code is writen nearly all features encounter bugs, often even after the feature is bought to the target audience. The bugs are listed in order of priority and Andy fixes them, one type of bug fixing is refactoring which means you don’t change the functionality of the code but just re-write it to be more elegant and readable. Alternatively the bug is an actual issue for the target audience and will need to be solved immediately.
  The third step is continued learning. Sterkowitz highlights that in his profession he always enounters jobs where he will need to learn something new, whether it be because a new technology has come out or the organisation has specified which technologies to use. Continued learning is a huge part of Andy’s job.
  The fourth step is communication. This simply means keeping in contact with clients, project managers, analyst and whoever else needs to kept up to date with his work. This might include progress reports, post analysis reports or just general back and forth communication.
  The fifth step is known as a production issue. Sterkowitz states that a production issue is basically a really big bug that is affecting a crucial part of the clients organisation, things like a system wide outage or issues with an important user such as the CEO of the organisation. When these problems occur it is Andy’s top priority to solve the issue as soon as possible and this is when long hours would come into play.
  Based on the video I think the hardest part about Andy’s job would be being the pressure of being on call for the production issues.<br>

                <h2>
                  Rafeh Qazi: Python developer
                </h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                These two Youtube videos are an autobiography type look into the life of a freelance python developer named Rafeh Qazi. Rafeh uses his knowledge of programming to engage with clients who are looking for a solution to their IT problem which requires programming. <br>the first video Rafeh tells the story of his very first client, which he landed by accident after advertising his expertise as a python/computer science tutor on craigslist. He was contacted by a company (the name of which he does not mention) that asked him if he was interested in working for them, Rafeh at this time was only an intermediate developer with no real work experience but he accepted the offer. During his first job he was forced to learn skills as they became necessary, some of those skills included how databases work, Django, Python, Flask as well as other business type skills such as negotiation and contract proposals.
He makes it easy to understand the difference between a ‘back end’ developer and a ‘front end’ developer using the ‘Facebook like’ as an example. He states that the ‘front end’ is the graphical part of the like button that you physically click on but when the ‘like’ itself is stored to the Facebook database, that process is the ‘back end’. <br>In the second video Rafeh gives you a brief look into the day to day life of a freelance developer such as himself. Rafeh spends most of his time at home, whether its at his desk with 2 monitors working away on a job or at his whiteboards he uses for brainstorming ideas before writing them into code. He also likes to fit in leisure activities such as boxing, relaxing and going out to see friends which he believes increases productivity.
The hardest part about this job would be managing your jobs urgency and importance. It would be easy to get to get carried away with one project. Motivating yourself from home would also take some practice.

                    Dani: Computer science student/Game developer
                  </h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Dani makes games while studying for his computer science degree in Norway. This video gives you a tour of his daily routine, on this particular day Dani has no classes until midday so he spends the morning working on the game he is personally making at the time. He begins simply with pen and paper and writes himself a plan for the day of what he wants to get done, once he has a structure for the day he jumps on the computer and starts reading some feedback about the game he is making. After making some tweaks to his own personal game Dani heads to university where he is working in a group of four to create a two dimesnional with java, he spenda around 4 hours working on this before heading home to work on his own game again.
Balancing a computer science degree with creating your own games would be no easy task and would require lots of focus and great time management, which Dani seems to do quite well.

                    <h2>
                      The Cyber Mentor: Ethical hacker/ Penetration tester
                    </h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    The type of work done by ‘the cyber mentor’ (the man in the video above) is known as ethical hacking/penetration testing. Essentially what that means is that a person or company will pay this man whatever is agreed to try his best to penetrate and or hack the network specified by the client. He explains that two main types of hacking are internal and external. External hacking is essentially trying to breach a network, database or server from the outside without anything other than the IP address range given by the client and the hackers own information gathering tools and techniques. Internal hacking on the other hand assumes that you are fully or partially in the network already and they want to see if hacking could be done from within by their own employees etc. Some tools used by ethical hackers for this process include Nmap, Nessus and Cobalt Strike. The average time taken for an external test is around 20-120 hours depending on the size of the job and around 1-4 weeks for internal testing.
Another type of hacking is ‘web application penetration testing’. This time instead of trying to penetrate a whole network, you are dealing with web applications. The hacker is trying to exploit or find weak points in the web applications and there can be many different web applications on one network. The cyber mentor explains that most of the work he does these days is web application testing as opposed to external/internal. He also explains that typically beginner hackers will start out with external hacking, then move onto internal and then finally onto web application testing. Web app penetration testing takes between 40-100 hours depending on the size of the job.
There is also ‘wireless network hacking’ using a ‘Wireless card’ the hacker does wireless penetration testing and if they can crack the wireless network password. If they are able to crack the password they will then see if any of the information that they have access to is sensitive.
The last and arguably the most interesting type of ethical hacking is physical/social penetration. The hacker will use information gathering techniques such as scanning social media accounts, company websites, google maps and even drone recon to try and find any physical sensitive information. Hackers can even be hired to see if they can physically make their way into a complex using a fake key/scanner, lock pick or even just blending into the crowd.
A common practice for ethical hackers is called ‘Purple Team Testing’. Two teams are formed, blue team tries to breach something and sees if the red team can see it happening, hence the ‘purple’.
Whatever type of hacking job is being executed, the hacker must always send an easily understood post-test report for the client to understand exactly what was wrong and what they have done to rectify it. Many hackers find this to be the worst/most tedious part of the job because just when you think it’s all over you have to go through and make it understandable to someone who has no knowledge of hacking.

                    <p>
                      In this video Grant Collins gives an overview of being a cybersecurity analyst and what’s involved. The job description of a cyber security anlyst is to detect and prevent cyber threats to an organisation. According to him a cybersecurity analyst is the entry level job of the cybersecurity world. In the video Grant lists the main responsibilities of a cyber secuirty analyst which are to:
    Analyze, maintain and update security policies and protocols
    Analyze, maintain and upgrade and  the current security system
    Start scans and security assesments that expose weaknesses
    Conduct annual audits
    Respond to current security alerts and threats
    Implement/manage network intrusion detection systems
    Train employees in Security awareness
    he also states that cybersecurity analyst is quite broad and can mean a lot of things depending on your specific job and place in the company you work for.
    Based on the video I think the hardest part about being a cyber security analyst would be making sure that everyone in the clients organisation follows the security protocols you have implemented.<br>

                        <h2>
                          Jobs in Australian Cyber Security:
                        </h2>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        The first video is an ABC news article that takes a brief look inside the Australian Cyber Security Centre. During the covid 19 pandemic there has been a spike in covid 19 themed cyber scams often in the form of a link relating to the government covid 19 stimulus package. The government is currently funding a $470 million dollar project for 500 new jobs at the Australian Signals directorate where the ACSC is located.
<br>In the second video DC goes into depth about the cyber security jobs on offer specifically in Australia. He begins with the topic of salaries and explains that most cyber security jobs are either private industry or government jobs. According to DC private industry jobs usually have better pay but government jobs have other perks like better hours and job stability. According to him entry level cyber security jobs in Australia pay around 80,000 to 95,000 per annum but more senior roles can pay 100,000 to 200,000 per annum. These are very good wages in Australia that are well above the average. DC states that 2 hotspots for cyber security jobs in Australia are Sydney and Canberra due to a government employment scheme, some jobs will offer help with relocation and even give you somewhere to stay. Most of these jobs are government (often with the department of defence) and require previous IT experience of some kind even if its not directly related to cyber security. He explains that cyber security as a specific profession is relatively new in Australia and it is very common for people to come from other IT professions and get skilled up as they go.

                        <p>
                      In these videos video Zac is giving some insight into the different types of jobs in the IT industry he begins by stating sometimes the same job can have a number of different titles such as helpdesk specialist helpdesk technician as an example. Zac then explains that if you have a passion for the programming side of things then its pretty safe for you to look for ‘developer’ IT jobs as these require programming, although Zac himself admits to hating this side of IT. If you are more into the helping people side of things Zac recommends any form of ‘helpdesk’ IT jobs such as helpdesk technician, IT support technician or IT analyst. After getting some experience under your belt in these helpdesk fields Zac moves on to state that you can make your way into the senior versions of these jobs such as senior analyst or Senior IT support technician. Another job he talks about is network technician which is someone who handles things like firewalls and VPN related jobs, he states that this job can lead to becoming a network engineer. He goes on to state that the apex jobs in the IT industry are the titles such as director of IT, CIO or chief technology officer, this job is the top of the IT chain but Zac explains that directors and CIO’s are more often than not in meetings and do mostly organizing rather than practical IT work.
