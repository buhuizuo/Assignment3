          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the obvious things such as team members falling sick, computer failure and so on, as far as risks go, there are a few, but these are relevant mainly to the app software development tools.
                <br>
                </p>
                <h5>
                  software development
                </h5>
                <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many tools available that are designed specifically for easy software development. These tools are designed for those who have limited programming skills. They offer a user interface-oriented design, much like the graphic user interface in Adobe Dreamweaver. Though this does limit creativity somewhat on the designers’ part due to having no coding support, it does make the development easier to do with limited coding experience. However, there are risks involved as each piece of software offers different aspects. Some have built in tools such as database creation or linking to an online database, building reminders, calendar, or date specific apps and so on. The risk here is that some software may contain elements we need, but not all of them. This may cause the design of the app to change by necessity based on what the app development software provides to us. The benefits we gain from a no code platform is that production time is quicker, and modifications are easy to make. However, there are risks that we can be constrained by what the software provides, many of the design elements are based off templates, we will not own the source code and there can be security issues also (Codebots 2021).
                </p>
                <h5>
              financial risk
              </h5>
              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a financial risk, though not incredibly high. The software development tool requires subscription, in this case it would be Appypie. For the absolute minimum, Appyepie’s lowest subscription fee is about $24 AUD per month. While it is the cheapest option, it is limited to Android development only. To include development for iOS, the subscription cost’s about $77 AUD per month (Appypie 2021). As we ideally would like to publish the app for iOS as well, the total cost would come to $924 AUD per year for the Appypie subscription, $127 per year for Apple store publishing, and $32 one time fee for Goole Play store publishing. This would come to a total of $1,083 AUD for the first year, and $1,051 AUD for subsequent years after due to Google Play being a one-time cost. Although fairly low in comparison to many small business overhead costs, it is still a significant amount of money to risk.
<br>
The difficulty here also is that many of these app development applications do not really detail their full capabilities. With that in mind, it means we would have to pay for at least a month to try the software and see if it meets our needs, if it does not we may then cancel and try another, but this means additional costs whenever we want to test a platform.
<br>
There is the low code option, where a platform is used to do the majority of the design, then a programmer is paid to finish it off. We do not want to do this though as we are moving towards working within the field ourselves, so paying a programmer to finish it off is more of an option designed for small businesses that do not employ programmers. In addition to that, it would also be an additional cost, so this is not considered either a viable option for us, or one we wish to take. We would much prefer to become more proficient in programming and do that aspect ourselves.
</p>
<br>
<h5>
other risks
</h5>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides hardware failure with our computers, illnesses, and other obligations, these are the main risks we are facing. Both a combination of a somewhat significant financial risk, and a risk of being constrained by software development tool limitations. In future however, with more experience and knowledge with programming, this will help us in mitigating both of these risks. If we can get to a point where we do not need easy app development software, we reduce both the limitations of the software, and the financial cost associated with it, leaving only the publishing costs which is a significant reduction to only $159 AUD for the first year, and $127 AUD for subsequent years after.
